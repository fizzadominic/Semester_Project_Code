This line of code is using the seekg() function to set the file pointer to the beginning of the file. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

inFile is an instance of the ifstream class, which represents a file stream for reading data from a file.
seekg() is a member function of the ifstream class that sets the position of the file pointer within the stream. The g in seekg() stands for "get", indicating that this function sets the read position within the stream.
The first argument to seekg() is an offset value that specifies the number of bytes to seek from the given reference point.
The second argument to seekg() is an ios::seekdir value that specifies the reference point from which to seek. In this case, ios::beg indicates that the offset value is relative to the beginning of the stream.
So, inFile.seekg(0, ios::beg); sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file by seeking an offset of 0 bytes from the beginning of the stream. This ensures that subsequent reads from the file will start from the beginning of the file.


 // to write in a text file
    // string text = "fizza dominic";
    // ofstream file("fizza.txt");
    // file << text;
    // to read a text file
